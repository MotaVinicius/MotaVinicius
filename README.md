Hey there 

📖 I'm a university student
🌱 I’m currently learning Web development (Js, React, Node)
👨🏻‍💻 A fact about me: I switched from business administration to my love for computers, so I enrolled in a computer networking course because my prior knowledge was more focused on hardware. However, there I learned more about programming and got captivated... Since then, I decided that I would become a developer.
